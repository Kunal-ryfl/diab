This report presents the development, architecture, and features of the Diabetes Prediction System, a web-based application designed to assist users in predicting the likelihood of diabetes based on essential health indicators. In response to the rising prevalence of diabetes and the growing demand for early risk assessment tools, the application aims to provide a quick and accessible way for users to gauge their health status. Utilizing technologies such as FastAPI for the backend and Next.js for the frontend, the application integrates multiple machine learning classifiers to deliver reliable predictions. The system accepts input fields including pregnancy count, age, glucose level, and other key health metrics, processing the data to generate a diabetes risk prediction. This report covers the entire project lifecycle, from design and implementation to testing and deployment, while addressing the challenges encountered and the strategies employed to enhance accuracy and user experience.
